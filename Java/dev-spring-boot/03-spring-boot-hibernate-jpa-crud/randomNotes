-- CommandLineRunner is an interface (implemented as a hook) from spring boot framework that allows us to run code after the application has just started  
  -- Primarily used for running the code at startup  
  -- It has a single run() method  
  --It is commonly used for:  
      -Initializing database data.  
      -Running startup tasks.  
      -Logging application startup information.  

-- To turn off the spring boot banner --> spring.main.banner-mode=off  
-- Reducing logging levels to only show logging --> logging.level.root=warn  

-- Entity Class --> Java class that is mapped to a database table  
  -- @Entity annotation  
  -- Must have atleast one public or protected no argument constructor  
    -- If you make a argument constructor java doesn't make a no argument constructor  
  -- @Table(name="student") --> To map a class to a database table  
  -- @Id --> Marks the primary key  
    -- Primary Key --> Identifies each row in a table uniquely (can't be a null value)  
      -- in MySql it can be set to AUTO_INCREMENT  
      -- in JPA @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.IDENTITY)  
        -- more generation types exist  
  -- @Column("columnName") --> Used to map a column to a field  
    -- It is optional  
    -- Without it the column name is the field name  

-- Data Access Object (DAO) is a way of organizing code to handle the communication between your program and a database  
  -- @Repository marks a class as a DAO  
-- Create Read Update Delete (CRUD)
